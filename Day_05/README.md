## **Day 5 â€“ 100 Days of Python**  

ðŸ“Œ **Today's Focus:**  
- Learning about loops (`for` and `while`) in Python  
- Understanding the concept of iteration  
- Applying loops to automate repetitive tasks  

ðŸ’¡ **Key Learnings:**  
- Writing `for` loops to iterate over sequences  
- Using `while` loops for condition-based repetition  
- Combining loops with conditionals for more control  
- Loop control keywords: `break`, `continue`, and `pass`  

ðŸ›  **Project of the Day â€“ Password Generator:**  
A Python program that generates random passwords with customizable length and complexity, combining letters, numbers, and symbols for strong security.  

âœ… **Progress:**  
Completed **Day 5** of the challenge! Strengthened my understanding of loops by building a practical tool that can be used in real life. ðŸš€
