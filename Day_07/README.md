## **Day 7 â€“ 100 Days of Python**  

ðŸ“Œ **Today's Focus:**  
- Exploring how to work with loops and lists together  
- Understanding nested loops and their use cases  
- Building more dynamic programs with iteration  

ðŸ’¡ **Key Learnings:**  
- Iterating over lists with `for` loops  
- Using nested loops for grid-like problems  
- Applying loops to automate repetitive tasks in larger programs  

ðŸ›  **Project of the Day â€“ Hangman Game:**  
Created a word-guessing game where the player tries to guess letters to reveal the hidden word, with limited attempts before losing.  

âœ… **Progress:**  
Completed **Day 7** of the challenge! Strengthened my loop skills and learned how to structure a slightly larger program. ðŸš€
