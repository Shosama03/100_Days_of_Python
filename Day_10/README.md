## **Day 10 â€“ 100 Days of Python**  

ðŸ“Œ **Today's Focus:**  
- Understanding functions with outputs  
- Learning how to return values from functions  
- Exploring multiple return values  
- Using docstrings for documentation  

ðŸ’¡ **Key Learnings:**  
- How `return` works inside functions  
- Returning multiple values from a single function  
- Difference between printing vs returning  
- Writing cleaner and reusable code with outputs  

ðŸ›  **Project of the Day â€“ Calculator Program:**  
Created a simple calculator that:  
- Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division  
- Uses functions that return values  
- Allows continuous calculations until the user decides to stop  

âœ… **Progress:**  
Completed **Day 10** of the challenge! Got comfortable with functions returning values and built a calculator program to apply the concept. âš¡
