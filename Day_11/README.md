# 🚀 Day 11 – Blackjack Capstone Project 🃏  

## 📌 Focus of the Day  
- Applying everything learned so far into a **bigger project**  
- Using **functions with return values**  
- Handling **loops, conditionals, and lists**  
- Implementing game logic step by step  
- Improving **problem-solving skills** through real coding challenges  

## 💡 Key Learnings  
- How to break down a big project into smaller functions  
- Importance of **clear rules** and implementing them in code  
- Randomness in Python using the `random` module  
- How to compare results logically and return the correct winner  
- Writing **clean, readable, modular code** for projects  

## 🛠 Project of the Day – Blackjack Game 🎲  
Built a simplified version of the **Blackjack card game** where:  
- Player and dealer each draw cards randomly  
- Ace can count as `1` or `11` depending on the situation  
- Player can choose to “hit” (draw another card) or “stand”  
- Game automatically declares **win, lose, or draw**  

## ✅ Progress  
Finished **Day 11/100** 🎉  
I’ve completed my first **big project (Blackjack)** in Python – learned a lot about **logic, flow control, and debugging**.
