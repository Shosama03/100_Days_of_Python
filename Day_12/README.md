# 🚀 Day 12 – Scope & Number Guessing Game 🎯  

## 📌 Focus of the Day  
- Understanding **Python scope rules**  
- Practicing **local vs global variables**  
- Using constants for readability and maintainability  
- Building another fun project to strengthen logic  

## 💡 Key Learnings  
- **Local Scope**: Variables created inside a function exist only there  
- **Global Scope**: Variables declared outside functions can be accessed everywhere  
- **Block Scope**: Python doesn’t have true block scope (e.g. inside `if`, `for`)  
- **Constants**: Declaring global values in UPPERCASE makes code cleaner and easier to manage  
- How to use scope rules effectively in projects  

## 🛠 Project of the Day – Number Guessing Game 🎲  
Created a number guessing game where:  
- Program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100  
- Player chooses difficulty: `easy` (10 attempts) or `hard` (5 attempts)  
- Player guesses the number, receiving feedback: **“Too high” / “Too low”**  
- Game ends when the player wins or runs out of attempts  

## ✅ Progress  
Finished **Day 12/100** 🎉  
Learned how to handle **scope in Python** and built a **Guess the Number game** from scratch.
