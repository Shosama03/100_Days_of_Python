## ðŸ“Œ Focus of the Day  
- Practicing **Python dictionaries & lists**  
- Working with **random.choice()**  
- Strengthening **game loops & control flow**  
- Creating a more **complex project with functions**  

## ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings  
- How to store data in a list of dictionaries (for accounts/celebrities)  
- Using **functions** to organize repetitive tasks (formatting, checking answers, etc.)  
- Clearing the console and keeping the game **interactive**

- If wrong â†’ Game ends, score is displayed.  

## âœ… Progress  
Finished **Day 14/100** ðŸŽ‰  
Created a **fully functional Higher Lower game**, improving my understanding of **data handling, functions, and control flow** in Python.
