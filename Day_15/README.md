# ðŸš€ Day 15 â€“ Coffee Machine Program â˜•  

## ðŸ“Œ Focus of the Day  
- Applying everything learned so far into a **larger project**  
- Working with **functions, loops, and conditionals** together  
- Practicing **nested dictionaries** to model real-world data  
- Handling **resources and transactions** in code  

## ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings  
- How to represent drinks and resources using nested dictionaries  
- Deducting ingredients after each coffee is made  
- Accepting coin input and calculating the transaction  
- Returning change when payment is successful  
- Shutting down or printing reports with simple commands  

## ðŸ›  Project of the Day â€“ Coffee Machine â˜•  
Created a coffee machine simulation that:  
- Lets the user pick from espresso, latte, or cappuccino  
- Deducts required ingredients from the machine resources  
- Handles payment through coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies)  
- Returns change if overpaid, denies if not enough money  
- Can generate a **report** of current resources and profit  

## âœ… Progress  
Completed **Day 15/100** ðŸŽ‰  
Built my first **large functional project** that brings together **functions, loops, conditionals, and data structures** into one real-world simulation.
