# ðŸš€ Day 16 â€“ Coffee Machine OOP â˜•  

## ðŸ“Œ Focus of the Day  
- Introduction to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python  
- Creating and using **classes & objects**  
- Understanding how to split code into **multiple classes** for better structure  
- Learning to **import classes** from different files/modules  

## ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings  
- Defining classes and methods (`__init__`, object attributes)  
- How to model real-world objects (like CoffeeMachine, Menu, MoneyMachine)  
- Encapsulation of functionality inside classes  
- Using `from module import ClassName` to organize a project into files  
- Importance of **abstraction** â†’ focusing on *what* each object does, not *how*  

## ðŸ›  Project of the Day â€“ Coffee Machine OOP â˜•  
Recreated the **coffee machine project** but now with **OOP principles**:  
- `Menu` class â†’ Handles drinks available  
- `MenuItem` class â†’ Represents each coffee type  
- `CoffeeMaker` class â†’ Manages machine resources (water, milk, coffee)  
- `MoneyMachine` class â†’ Handles coin transactions  

This version is **cleaner, scalable, and modular** compared to the Day 15 functional approach.  

## âœ… Progress  
Finished **Day 16/100** ðŸŽ‰  
Learned the **foundations of OOP** and applied it to a practical project. This marks the start of writing **cleaner, real-world structured code**.
