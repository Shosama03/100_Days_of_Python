# 🚀 Day 17 – Quiz Project with OOP 🎓  

## 📌 Focus of the Day  
- Continuing with **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
- Designing multiple classes that work together  
- Understanding how to structure a bigger project with OOP principles  

## 💡 Key Learnings  
- Creating a **Question class** to model question text & answer  
- Building a **QuizBrain class** to handle quiz logic (question order, checking answers, score tracking)  
- Using objects to represent real-world entities → cleaner, reusable code  
- Importance of separating **data, logic, and presentation**  

## 🛠 Project of the Day – Quiz Game ❓  
Developed a **true/false quiz game** where:  
- Questions are stored as a list of `Question` objects  
- The `QuizBrain` object controls question flow and keeps score  
- Player gets instant feedback (right/wrong)  
- Game ends with a final score summary  

## ✅ Progress  
Finished **Day 17/100** 🎉  
Built my **first multi-class OOP project** — the Quiz Game. Learned how to split logic into classes and connect them together for a clean, modular program.
