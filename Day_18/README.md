# 🚀 Day 18 – Turtle Graphics & the Hirst Painting 🎨🐢  

## 📌 Focus of the Day  
- Introduction to **Python’s Turtle Graphics** module  
- Learning how to draw shapes and patterns with code  
- Using loops and randomization for creative designs  
- Exploring how to extract colors from an image using `colorgram`  

## 💡 Key Learnings  
- How to use the **Turtle module** to draw lines, shapes, and move the turtle around  
- Changing pen color, speed, and direction  
- Using the `colorgram` library to extract RGB values from an image  
- Creating **randomized patterns** with loops  
- Understanding how art and code can combine for creative projects  

## 🛠 Project of the Day – Hirst Dot Painting 🖌️  
Recreated Damien Hirst’s famous spot paintings using code:  
- Extracted 30 RGB colors from an image with `colorgram`  
- Placed 10x10 rows of colored dots on the screen  
- Each dot chosen randomly from the extracted palette  
- Created a beautiful, colorful painting completely generated with Python 🎨  

## ✅ Progress  
Completed **Day 18/100** 🎉  
Explored Python’s **Turtle Graphics** and built the **Hirst Painting generator**. This was a fun blend of **art + programming**.
