# 🚀 Day 19 – Turtle Race Game 🐢🏁  

## 📌 Focus of the Day  
- Practicing more with the **Turtle Graphics** module  
- Introduction to **event listeners** in Python  
- Making programs **interactive** with user input  
- Building a simple game using loops & conditions  

## 💡 Key Learnings  
- Using `screen.listen()` and `screen.onkey()` to detect keypresses  
- Moving turtles independently with functions bound to keys  
- Setting up the game screen and controlling multiple objects  
- Randomizing movements for unpredictability  
- Handling **user interaction** in a graphical environment  

## 🛠 Project of the Day – Turtle Race 🐢  
Created a fun game where:  
- Player bets on which turtle (color) will win the race  
- Multiple turtles line up at the starting line  
- Each turtle moves forward by a random amount in each step  
- First turtle to reach the finish line is declared the winner 🎉  

## ✅ Progress  
Completed **Day 19/100** 🎉  
Built my **first interactive game** in Python using **Turtle Graphics + Event Listeners**. Super fun project!
