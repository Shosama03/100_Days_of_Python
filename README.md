# 🐍 100 Days of Python Programming  

## 🚀 About This Challenge
Welcome to my **100 Days of Python Programming** journey!  
Over the next 100 days, I will be building **100 real-world Python projects** — starting from **beginner-friendly scripts** to **advanced applications**.  
This repository will serve as a **public log** of my progress, coding style, and learning curve.  

## 🎯 Goals
- Strengthen Python fundamentals
- Explore intermediate to advanced Python concepts
- Practice **problem-solving** and **project structuring**
- Showcase projects to recruiters and collaborators

## 📂 Project Structure
Each day has its **own folder** with:
1. Python source code  
2. A `README.md` explaining the project  

Example:

## 📅 Daily Log
| Day | Project Name | Status |
|-----|--------------|--------|
| 1   | Band Name Generator | ✅ |
| 2   | Tip Calculator | ⏳ |
| ... | ... | ... |
